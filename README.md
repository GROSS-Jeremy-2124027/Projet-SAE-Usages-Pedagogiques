Project pedagogical uses
---------------------------------------------------------
Hello,
This is a repository for our application that we made me and my friends for a school project.
We were four on it (me, Nathan Vigon, Fran√ßois Toureille and Arthur Lecomte), and we had only two week to make it. Some class were given at the start, so we don't write everythings. But we made the main of the code.
You have to launch the class "AccueilMain" to run the application.
Personnaly, I think I will work on this projetc again to improve the interfaces. 
This project has been writed in java, javafx and fxml. Firstly, you can found an home page, were you can see a link for a form online, that I made with HTML and CSS.
Then, you have a help button, that show you some help for using our app (actually, it's not hard to use our app...). Also, you have a connexion button that ask you an user id and a password (the user is "admin" and the password is "password"), but we don't made the next part of when you are connected. Normally, the admin can add what they want into our database, but we don't made it cause of time and because it was too hard for us. After, you have a page were you can choose the view of the uses : 
either by academies or by theme. And when you choose a view, you have it and you can choose your academy or thematics to view the attached uses.
